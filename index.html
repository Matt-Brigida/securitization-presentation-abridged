	  <h3>What should make sense by the end of this presentation ...</h3>
	  <p class="fragment fade-in">How securitization makes <b class="fragment highlight-green">financing assets cheaper</b>,</p>
	  <p class="fragment fade-in">and how it makes some assets receive financing that otherwise <b class="fragment highlight-red">wouldn't</b></p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h3>Securitization means ...</h3>

	  <p style="text-align:left;">The transformation of a set of (generally) illiquid assets into a tradeable portfolio of these assets.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p style="text-align:left;">A classic example is mortgage loans.</p>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    A classic example is a set of mortgage loans.  Each loan alone is not a tradeable security, however a portfolio of thousands of mortgages can be packaged and turned into a security.
	    However we can securitize a side variety of assets---David Bowie famously securitized royalty payments for his songs.
	  </aside>

	<section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>What can we securitize?</h3>
	    <p style="text-align:left;" class="fragment highlight-current-blue">
	      Any asset which generates a stream of cash flows (often loans, but can also be leases and other trade receivables).
	    </p>
	    <p style="text-align:left;" class="fragment highlight-current-blue">
	      To securitize an asset it is necessary to be able to statistically describe the assets' cash flows.
	    </p>
	    <p style="text-align:left;" class="fragment highlight-current-blue">
	      The ownership of the assets must also be transferable.
	    </p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      "Statistically describe" => such as expected cash flows, variance and covariances.
	    </aside>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p style="text-align:left;">Assets are more appropriate for securitization if:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">they provide diversification---geographic or economic.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">there is a large number of assets.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">there correlation structure is known, and the assets preferably have low correlations.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-red"> Correlation is key...</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h3>Why Securitize Assets?</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">diversification</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">financial engineering---structuring tranches to meet different risk-reward profiles, and investment horizons.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">increased liquidity.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      - desired by present market participants. This allows us to target risk/return profiles which are desirable to a larger pool of investors.
	    </aside>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">lower transaction costs in secondary market.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">moves assets off of a firm's balance sheet </li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">lowers funding costs.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      Note: lowers funding costs => and securitization may allow the financing of assets that would not receive financing individually.
	      Moves assets off BS great if assets are illiquid
	      Moves off BS:  (1) on BS they may be subject to a higher discount rate.  Also, the originator receives an immediate lump sum in exchange for future payments, and therefore can make new loans.
	    </aside>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Separates the credit rating of the originator from the security.  </li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Facilitates geographic dispersion of funding to areas underserved by depository institutions.</li>
	      <li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Issuers can tailor the maturity, yield, and seniority to suit investor preference. </li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      Separate credit rating => This means the security can have a higher credit rating (and therefore lower yield) that if it were help on the originators balance sheet.

    <h3>Background and History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Pre-1970s:</b>  Securitization was an effectively <b class="fragment highlight-red">non-existent</b> industry. </li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">1970s:</b>Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac started providing a guarantee on mortgage pass-through securities. </li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">1983:</b> Fannie Mae issued the first Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO). CMOs address <b class="fragment highlight-red">pre-payment risk</b> by tranching. </li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">1985:</b> Asset Backed Security (ABS) offerings.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      Securitizing mortgages => This made obtaining mortgage financing much easier for consumers, because securitization allowed lenders to easily move mortgages off their balance sheet if they needed to, or were concerned about interest rate risk.
      CMOs: widen the investor base in MBS by separating the security into tranches which determine payment precedence.
      First ABS: Sperry Lease Finance Corp. securitized computer equipment leases.
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Today</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Common to securitize <b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">auto loans</b>, <b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">credit card receivables</b>, <b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">student loans</b>, <b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">entertainment royalties</b>, and <b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">home equity loans</b> among other assets.</li>
      <li>Annual issuance in the <b class="fragment highlight-green">trillions</b> of dollars.</li>
      <li>    <a href="https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/ProductAttachments/Spotlight%20on%20structured%20finance.pdf">Securitization Finances 30% of US Capital Markets Funding Needs Annually and 40% Historically</a></li>

    <h3>Steps in the Securitization Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Assets are created. </li>
      <li> A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created and ownership of the assets is transferred to the SPV.</li>
      <li> A claim structure, and credit enhancements, are added to the cash flows generated by the assets in the SPV.  </li>
      <li>The SPV issues the claims as securities.</li>
      <li> NRSROs rate the claims.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="notes">
      Example asset creation: the origination of a loan.
      Originator receives a sales price on transfer to SPV.
      NRSRO rating: This is important from a regulatory standpoint.  It affects who can purchase the securities.

    <h3>Participants in Securitizations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Originator</b>: initially originates the loan or asset.</li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Special Purpose Vehicle</b>:  a legally separate entity which holds the assets bought from the originator.</li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Trust</b>:  the assets may be held by the SPV, or transferred to a trust.</li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Underwriters</b>: lessen risk in the security's sale, and often assist in structuring the security.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Dealers</b>:  make a secondary market in the security.</li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Rating agencies (NRSROs)</b>:  determine the likelihood of default (amount of credit risk) in the security. </li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Insurers</b>:  Private companies and government agencies ensure payment for a fee or through credit default swaps.</li>
      <aside class="notes">
	Credit rating: This is done on an ongoing basis.  Such ratings are not required if the security will be sold in a private placement, however most ABS and MBS are rated.  The ratings determine which sets of investors can buy the security.
      </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Servicers</b>:  collects payments from borrowers (or asset) and forwards them through to the SPV.</li>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Investors</b>:  households, institutions, and governments.</li>    
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      The servicer earns a fee for this work.
      Affected by whether NRSROs rate the security as "investment-grade".

<!-- start isolation section -->
<section>
  <h3>Isolation</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">A key point of securitization is to isolate the assets (and the cash flows they generate) from the originator of the assets.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Originator is not liable for payments.</li>
    <li>The transfer of ownership from the originator to the SPV is a "true sale".</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    The originator may thereafter act as a servicer of the assets.

<section>
  <section>
    <h3>Credit Enhancement</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Methods used to lessen the risk borne by investors in a securitization.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Tranching</b>: Transfers risk from one subset of the security’s investors to another by assigning securities first, second, third, etc claim on cash flows.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
            Tranching: assigning subsets of the security first, second, third, etc claim on the cash flows from the underlying assets.  Cash flows form a *waterfall* down through the tranches, and so losses are incurred from the bottom tranche up.  This doesn't lessen the risk of the overall security---just transfers risk from one subset of the security's investors to another.
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
        <h3>Credit Enhancement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Overcollateralization</b>: the security collateral exceeds the value of the security ensuring, that even with some default on underlying assets, the security can make timely payments.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
        <h3>Credit Enhancement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="fragment highlight-current-blue">Third-party guarantee</b>:  an entity assumes some of the bondholders' risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      Guarantee: This may be through forms of bond insurance, and maybe purchased form private entities, or often the government (for example the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the U.S.).

  <section>
    <h3>Is There a Downside to Securitization?</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;">This process relies on the <b class="fragment highlight-red">investors ability to determine the underlying asset credit risk</b>, and thereby relies on credit rating agencies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> If the risk is assessed incorrectly, this will cause misallocation of funds.</li>
      <li>This is exacerbated by complex capital structures, the separation of ownership and origination, and the origination incentive system.  </li>
      <li>Example: US housing market prior to 2008.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      Since securitization is a powerful tool to funnel capital to borrowers, the misallocation of this capital may cause substantial distortions.
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13255.pdf">Securitization: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead</a> for a good summary of how components of the securitization process failed in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis.</li>

    <h2> An Example</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p style="text-align:left;"><b class="fragment highlight-red">The Problem</b>: The <b class="fragment highlight-red">risks</b> and costs of biomedical research have increased due to underlying factors in the research and approval process.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This has lessened the ability of traditional public and private equity to finance such research.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      Lessened particulary given their investment horizon constraints and more stringent requirements on real-time pricing of investments.
